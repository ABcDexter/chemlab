chemlab is a library and a set of utilities meant to handle computational chemistry data. It
takes inspiration to other python scientific library such as numpy scipy and matplotlib, and aims
to bring a consistent and simple API following the python guidelines.

The project status is still at the stage 'proof-of-concept' and it includes basic data structures, some
integration for reading GROMACS produced files and most notably a flexible molecular viewer. Ideally,
chemlab will provide an effective way to write chemical scripts and applications.

There is not yet a well-defined installation method, the dependencies at the moment are:

- pyglet (for the molecular viewer)
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
