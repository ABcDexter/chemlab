Intro
=====

chemlab is designed to be like a library that you can use to make and
customize your own programs, it provides classes for chemical objects,
data tables and routines for computational chemistry purposes.  It is
made to be "scalable", that is it contains complete routines and
tools, while allowing yourself to make your own program in a simple
and effective way.

chemlab is divided in several packages that can be used almost
independently.

  - chemlab.graphics includes a molecular viewer and its components.
  - chemlab.molsim molecular simulation routines
  - chemlab.core basic data structures such as atoms, molecules etc
  - chemlab.data database for various chemical data
  - chemlab.io input/output utilities and integration with other
    molecular packages.
