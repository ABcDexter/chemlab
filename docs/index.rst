chemlab at a glance
===================

chemlab is designed to be a library that can be used to perform
chemistry-relevant calculations with the flexibility and power of the
python programming language. It aims to be well-designed and pythonic,
taking inspiration from project such as numpy and scipy.

Chemistry is much aided by visualization tools, and chemlab includes
also a 3D molecular viewer based on pyglet.
