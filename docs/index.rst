Welcome to chemlab's documentation!
===================================

chemlab is designed to be a library that can be used to perform
chemistry-relevant calculations with the flexibility and power of the
python programming language. It aims to be well-designed and pythonic,
taking inspiration from project such as numpy and scipy.

Features:

* array oriented: most operations and data structures are based on numpy arrays.
               This let you write compact and efficient code.
* visualization: chemlab includes a 3D molecular viewer. It is designed to be easily extendable
               and to write your own tools in a programmatic way.
* convenience: chemlab aim is to be interoperable with other chemistry programs, making it useful to 'glue toghether'
               different functions.
